# Iron-Bank
 Overview: The Iron Bank of Braavos has called in its debts, and as the Master of Coin for the realm,
 you must repay a sum of S gold dragons. You have unlimited access to a set of coin denominations
 minted by various houses across the Seven Kingdoms.
 Your goal is to try to gather coins that total exactly S gold dragons. You can use as many coins as
 needed from any denomination, including multiple coins of the same value. However, the Iron Bank
 values efficiency; they demand that you use the minimum number of coins to settle the debt.
 Input: The input consists of 2 lines. The first line contains a list of available denominations. The
 second line contains a single integer, S.
 1. Every coin denomination, di, is within the range: 1 ≤ di ≤ 103
 2. 1 ≤S≤105- the total sum you need to repay.
 Output: Output a single integer- the minimum number of coins required to accumulate exactly S
 gold dragons. Or, if you cannot make exactly the sum S, return-1.
